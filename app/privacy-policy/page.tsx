            Thanks for stopping by! This Privacy Policy is just here to let you know how things 
            work around here. My website is mainly about showcasing my work, and I'm all about

            What Information I Collect (Hint: Not Much)
          </h2>
          <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Honestly, this is just a portfolio site, so I don't actively collect any personal 
            information. There's no account creation, no tracking cookies, and definitely no 
            sneaky data gathering.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6">Contact Info</h3>
          <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed">
            If you reach out via email or the contact form, the info you provide is entirely 
            up to you. I'll only use it to reply and have a conversation with you—no funny 
            business. When you submit the contact form, I collect:

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80 ml-4 mt-3">
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>Your email address</li>
            <li>Your message</li>
            <li>A timestamp and ticket ID for reference</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mt-3">
            That's it. Nothing more, nothing less.

            Here's what I might do with any information I collect:

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-foreground/80 ml-4">
            <li>Make sure the site is running smoothly</li>
            <li>Improve the website based on feedback you might share</li>
            <li>Respond to your questions or feedback</li>

            Sharing Your Info (Spoiler: I Don't)

          <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed">
            I don't sell, trade, or rent your personal info. If you shared something sensitive 
            by accident, feel free to reach out, and I'll help you remove it.

          <p className="text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed">
            I'll do my best to keep any info you share safe, but let's be real—no system is 
            foolproof. While I'll take reasonable steps to protect your info, I can't promise 
            100% security.

            This policy is current as of December 2025. If I make any changes, I'll update 
            it here, so you're always in the loop. Feel free to check back occasionally, 
            but don't worry—I'm not making any big changes without letting you know.
